We automate outreach, rankings, and  discovery of affiliates, creators and ambassadors using LLM-driven workflows. The team is small and experienced, and we move quickly. I'm looking for an experienced full stack engineer to join the team - the right candidate will have a large degree of freedom in building the product, but plenty of support to get up and running. Our current stack is Typescript, Next.js, vercel, but we're actively looking at options for some of the more data intensive workflows. Real world experience with AI coding agents a must.

Our approach differs from LLMs in that we compose algorithms symbolically to represent complex knowledge, and perform probabilistic computations. This enables the AI-driven application of statistical models to different problems, while providing the user with a verifiable reasoning path, and an assessment of the uncertainty in each answer. We are developing applications for analysis and research in domains such as Finance, Strategy Consulting, Engineering, Material Sciences, and more. This is an opportunity for senior engineers and product managers to join us, and contribute to shaping a deep-tech product from its earliest stage. We’re hiring for the following openings: * Program Synthesis Engineer * Bayesian Software Engineer * Senior Product ",
